= smart-retry - a reference implementation solving the GTOPX mission design benchmarks

`smart-retry` provides a C++ implementation solving the GTOPX space 
mission design optimization benchmarks 
http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[GTOPX space benchmarks], see 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235271102100011X[GTOPX paper].
Uses the same parallel smart retry algorithm as implemented 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es[here] 
in Python and https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java[here] in Java. 
The single CPU solution times may serve as a reference point to measure the scaling
of a http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/PDPTA20_Messenger.pdf[clustered algorithm].

=== Performance

The expected solution times to reach a specific threshold 
near the absolute optimum are given in the tables below. Results are for Linux and the 16 core AMD 5950x CPU.

|=========================================================

Note that the threshold value determines success, and
'mean time' includes the time for failed runs.
The same optimization algorithm
was applied for all problems, using the same parameters.

=== Compilation

* Use gcc versions >= 7.5 or clang >= 6.0

* You need as include files:
- https://github.com/imneme/pcg-cpp/blob/master/include/pcg_random.hpp
- http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/gtopx/cpp/gtopx.cpp
- https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/tree/master/Eigen

On Windows use the Linux subsystem for Windows:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Linux subsystem] or
- https://superuser.com/questions/1271682/is-there-a-way-of-installing-ubuntu-windows-subsystem-for-linux-on-win10-v170[Ubuntu subsystem].

=== Usage

After compiling run the executable routing stdout to a log file
to execute 100 benchmark runs for each GTOPX problem. Runs
more than a day even on fast CPUs. Adapt smartretry.cpp to modify the experiment.
